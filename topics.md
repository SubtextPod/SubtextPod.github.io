Want to be on the podcast but don't know what to talk about? Some ideas to get started are below. If you are interested in discussing any of these or have another texting question that you would like answered, reach out to [subtextpodcast@gmail.com](subtextpodcast@gmail.com).

## Subtext Topics 

The topics here are just guidelines - mostly inspired by conversations or interesting research. Sample question types and a brief description of the research follows - though it is intentionally broad since each situation brings has its own unique factors. 

**Punctuation (ellipses, periods)**

* What punctuation do you use? Does it ever get misinterpreted? Are there any punctuation marks that you really dislike other people using? 
* Our punctuation often acts as a fingerprint, and the way that we punctuate our messages is highly individual. At the same time, punctuation marks mean something, and when there are no physical cues, punctuation often has to step in and help clarify what is intended.

**Acronyms (wyd, wya, ttyl, lol, imho, nbd, jk, np)**

* Are there any acronyms that you love to use? Any that you can't stand? Are there certain people you use acronyms with? Has anyone used acronyms with you on a dating platform? 
* Acronyms have a long history in chat and messaging platforms that came before phones, or even the modern internet. But as text messaging has become nearly universal, many of these have changed from simply representing the words and phrases they stand for into having meanings of their own (which makes receiving them sometimes ambiguous)

**Timing**

* How long do you wait (in minutes/hours/days) before writing someone back? Do you ever read into it when someone else writes back too quickly or too slowly?
* The delay between messages tells us something about how invested another person is. Yet, writing back too quickly can be interpreted as desperation or worse.

**Messages before meeting**

* How many messages do you send before setting up a date? Does anyone ever suggest a date before you are ready? Should males/females make the first move towards setting up a meeting?
* On a certain level, we need to build trust before agreeing to meet in person, but where is the line between establishing trust (and interest) and losing the momentum and opportunity?

**Sexting**

* Have you ever matched with someone who wants to sext much too early or too much? Or has taken sexting too far?
* There is a strong relationship between sexting and attachement style - people who sext a lot or very early tend to have insecure attachment styles.

**Pictures**

* When is it appropriate to send pictures, and of what?
* Pictures help us build trust and intimacy by sharing our visual experiences, but they can easily be abused.

**Snapchat**

* Have you ever dated someone who only communicated via Snapchat (or IG or FB, etc.)? Did it ever get off of that platform?
* Digital technologies have radically changed the organization of our world, resulting in something called "context collapse" where all of our relationships are mediated through the same device. One way to push back on the effets of this is to keep people relegated to one platform or another. 

**Facetime/Phone Calls**
* When is it appropriate to incorporate Facetime or phone calls? 
* Often thought of as a compromise between texting and face-to-face conversations, both of these platforms mediate a conversation in a way that is very different from either written or IRL interactions - in a way that is not necessarily a midpoint between them. 

**Emojis**

* How many emojisa re appropriate? Have you ever received too many? Not enough? REceived them too soon?
* Emojis do affective work in a conversation, so they help set the tone, clarify meaning, and communicate emotions. Though they are nearly universal, their use is not widely agreed upon. 

**Emoticons (faces made with punctuation - different from emojis)**

* Are you an emoticon user? Do you know one? What do you think about your emoticons becoming emojis in iMessage?
* Emoticons have been around since the early days of chat - long before emojis. Their use has become rather standardized - kind of like a punctuation mark to tell you to read between the lines. 

**iPhone/Android**

* Are you an iPhone or Android user? Do you hesitate when you are matched with someone who is the other?
* As we are becoming increasingly attached to our devices, they are more deeply embedded into our lives - resulting in very personal feelings about platforms. 

**Gifs**

* Do you ever use gifs, and if so, with whom?
* Gifs are another example of sharing a multimodal experience - referencing something outside of the conversation that both people can refer to. But they should be used sparingly.

**Bitmoji**

* Do you have a bitmoji? Who do you send you bitmoji to? Has anyone sent a bitmoji when it wasn't appropriate? 
* Bitmojis are customized stickers, we tend to use them with our innermost circle of friends and family since they are often a caricature of ourselves.
